    <p class="p">
        Hummingbirds are found only in the Western Hemisphere, with almost half the species living in the "equatorial
        belt" between 10 degrees north and south of the equator.<br>
        The hummingbird family is very large, with over 330 species and 115 genera, mostly south of the U.S.
        Hummingbirds are found only in the Western Hemisphere,<br><br> with almost half the species living in the
        "equatorial belt" between 10 degrees north and south of the equator.<br>
        Hummingbirds comprise the family Trochilidae, among the smallest of birds, with most species measuring in the
        3"-5" range. <br>
        Hummingbirds spend the winter in Central America or Mexico, and migrate north to their breeding grounds in the
        southern U.S.<br> as early as February, and to areas further north later in the spring. The first arrivals in
        spring are usually males. <br>
        Fewer than two dozen species venture into the U.S. and Canada, and only a few species remain year-round. <br>
