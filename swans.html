    <h1 class="h1">About Swans<br></h1>
    <p class="p">The Swan is the largest waterfowl species of the subfamily Anserinae, family Anatidae (order
        Anseriformes).<br> Most swans are classified in the genus Cygnus. Swans are gracefully long-necked,
        heavy-bodied, big-footed birds<br> that glide majestically when swimming and fly with slow wingbeats and with
        necks outstretched.<br> They migrate in diagonal formation or V-formation at great heights,<br> and no other
        waterfowl moves as fast on the water or in the air.<br></p>

    <h2 class="h2">Diet<br></h2>
    <p class="p">Swans feed by dabbling (not diving) in shallows for aquatic plants.<br> Swimming or standing, the mute
        (C. olor) and black (C. atratus) swans often tuck one foot over the back.<br> Male swans, called cobs, and
        females, called pens, look alike<br>Legend to the contrary, swans utter a variety of sounds from the windpipe,
        which in some species is looped within the breastbone (as in cranes);<br> even the mute swan, the least vocal
        species, often hisses, makes soft snoring sounds, or grunts sharply.<br></p>
    <h2 class="h2">Behavior<br></h2>
    <p class="p">Swans are sociable except in breeding season.<br> They mate for life. Courtship involves mutual bill
        dipping or head-to-head posturing. The pen incubates, on average,<br> a half-dozen pale unmarked eggs on a heap
        of vegetation while the cob keeps close guard; in some species he takes his turn at brooding.<br> After
        repulsing an enemy, swans utter a triumph note, as geese do. The young, called cygnets, emerge short-necked and
        thickly downed;<br> though capable of running and swimming a few hours after hatching, they are carefully tended
        for several months;<br> in some species they may ride about on their motherâ€™s back.<br> Immature birds wear
        mottled gray or brown plumage for two or more years.<br> Swans mature in the third or fourth year and live
        perhaps 20 years in the wild and 50 years or more in captivity.<br></p>
